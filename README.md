This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is my solution to the take home prompt provided by TC.

I spent about 3 hours getting the basic functionality to work, and then another 2
for styling and input validation. I ran in to some issues with [redux-form](https://redux-form.com/7.3.0/) during the validation portion of this; I'm not sure
if this is a bug in redux-form or simply me not using async validation correctly
(this is my first attempt at using that piece of functionality).

To run the code, clone this repository and then `npm i; npm start`
